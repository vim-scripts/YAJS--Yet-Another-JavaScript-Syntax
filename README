Yet Another JavaScript Syntax file for Vim. Key differences:

 *  Use 'javascript' as group name's prefix, not 'javaScript' or 'JavaScript'. Works great with SyntaxComplete.
 *  Recognize Web API and DOM keywords. Keep increase.
 *  Works perfect with javascript-libraries-syntax.vim
 *  Remove old, unused syntax definitions.
 *  Support several ES6 new syntax, ex: arrow function =>.
